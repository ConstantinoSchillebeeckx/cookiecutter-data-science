This `reports/` directory will contain any finalized reports generated by this analysis; any figures generated in this report will be found in `reports/figures/'

In order to generate a finalized report one should:
1. Write up a report using Jupyter notebook, saving it in `notebooks/reports`
   - note that any figure referenced in this notebook should use the symlink foundat `notebooks/reports/figures/`
2. Run `make report` - this will generate both .html and .md formats of the reports and place them in the `reports/` directory
   - the .html format can easily be viewed through a web browser
   - the .md format can easily be viewed on Github
