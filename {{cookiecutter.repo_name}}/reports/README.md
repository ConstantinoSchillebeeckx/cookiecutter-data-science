This directory will contain any finalized reports generated by this analysis; any figures generated in this report will likewise be found in [`reports/figures/`](../reports/figures/)

In order to generate a finalized report one should:

1. Write up a report using Jupyter notebook, saving it in [`notebooks/reports`](../notebooks/reports/)
   - note that any figure referenced in this notebook should use the `figures/` symlink found at [`notebooks/reports/`](../notebooks/reports/figures/)
2. Run `make report` from the project root - this will generate both .html and .md formats of the reports and automatically place them in the [`reports/`](../reports/) directory.  The two formats are generated so that:
   - the .html format can easily be viewed through a web browser
   - the .md format can easily be viewed on Github

:warning: as a convenience, running `make push` will automatically generate reports.
