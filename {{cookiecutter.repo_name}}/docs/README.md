# Usage

This document is a simple helper doc to point out various housekeeping issues regarding this cookiecutter. :poop:

## Generated figures

All generated figures should be placed in [`/reports/figures/`]('../reports/figures'). It is assumed that many of these figures will be referenced in any report that is generated; when referencing an image from within a report (notebooks which are located in [`/notebooks/reports/']('../notebooks/reports') the image src should point to the symlink located in ['/notebooks/reports/figures']('../notebooks/reports/figures'). This symlink exists because the exported reports ('make report') assume a relative src which would otherwise not work if this symlink isn't used (see [Issue #58](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science/issues/58#issuecomment-261743145)) Therefore, when referencing a generated image from within a report notebook you'd use something like `<img src="figures/img.png" />`

:warning: when generating reports (`make report`) both an *.html* and *.md* format are generated - SVG is not supported in the *.md* version and will not render properly.

## Automatic table of contents

Table of contents for any notebook can automatically be generated by issuing the command `make notebook_toc`; this will call the script `scr/setup/make_notebook_toc.py` which will generate a hierarchical README.md file that will be placed within ['/notebooks']('../reports'). This is a quick method for summarizing the contents of any notebooks that resides within the ['/notebooks']('../reports'). 

This workflow assumes a bit of formatting within the notebook:

1. Only markdown cells with a heading (e.g. #, ##) will be used to populate the table of contents
2. The heading level of the markdown cell constitutes the hierarchy of the table of contents
3. Except for the top level (e.g. #) only the heading title will be used in the table of contents; for the top heading, any text used after the heading will be added to the table of contents. For example, a notebook might being with a markdown cell formatted with

```
# Introduction
 
This text will make it into the table of contents
```
